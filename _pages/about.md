I am a second-year PhD student at the TU Dublin, advised by Dympna O’Sullivan, Lucy Hederman and Robert Ross.

My research interests lie in the area of Learning and Language Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, and Technology Design.

Prior to my PhD, I have completed a Bachelor’s degree and a Master’s degree in General and Computational Linguistics at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.
