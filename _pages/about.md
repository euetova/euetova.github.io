I'm a UX Researcher, a Computational Linguist, and an E-Learning Developer with versatile experience in linguistics, programming, and the creation of educational materials. 

My research interests lie in the area of Learning and Language Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, and Technology Design.

My core research interest is understanding how technology and information can enhance the way we learn and deliver education. I utilize my expertise in design methodologies to co-develop new learning technologies, environments, and socio-technical systems to promote equitable opportunities for learners. My collaborators and I then utilize a variety of methodologies, ranging from qualitative case studies to quantitative modeling of data, to understand the efficacy and impact of our designs. My work sometimes touches on design (creating the technology and learning environments), understanding learners, and the broader societal contexts (e.g. social inequalities, education institutions) within which learning happens with technology.
