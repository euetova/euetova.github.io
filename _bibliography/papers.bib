  abstract={Conversational agents are becoming more common in the health and wellness domains in part due to assumptions regarding potential improvements in individuals’ outcomes. This paper presents initial findings from a review of conversational agent use in healthcare for chronic conditions and well-being. A search of the literature was performed on electronic databases PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Scopus and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included if they were focused on chronic disorder management, disease prevention or lifestyle change and if systems were tested on target user groups. This paper investigates the health domains, the user profiles and reasons why conversational agents may be helpful in the selfmanagement of chronic disease and well-being. This paper also discusses how these tools may be used to improve the health and well-being of different groups of people.},

  abstract = {Prolonged sedentary behavior and insufficient physical activity increase the risk for non-communicable diseases. Online peer support groups, driven by the widespread use of mobile phones and social media, have gained popularity among people seeking health condition management advice. This position paper examines the role of online peer support groups within a behaviour change intervention, MOV’D (Move Often eVery Day), which promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior in the workplace. We conducted a thematic analysis of post-study interviews from two randomized control trials to identify the benefits and limitations of online peer support groups and provide recommendations for improvement. We found that participation in online peer support groups contributes to a sense of belonging and accountability, helps to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and application of the intervention content, and serves as reminders encouraging physical activity throughout the day. However, participants do not always have enough time and cognitive resources to read all the messages and actively participate in the group chats. Individual differences also contribute to a decrease in overall chat activity, as the group chat does not always meet all participant’s preferences and needs.},

  journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
  abstract = {Objective: With the increasing global burden of chronic diseases, there is the potential for conversational agents (CAs) to assist people in actively managing their conditions. This paper reviews different types of CAs used for chronic condition management, delving into their characteristics and the chosen study designs. This paper also discusses the potential of these CAs to enhance the health and well-being of people with chronic conditions. Methods: A search was performed in February 2023 on PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included if they focused on chronic disease management or prevention and if systems were evaluated on target user groups. Results: The 42 selected studies explored diverse types of CAs across 11 health conditions. Personalization varied, with 25 CAs not adapting message content, while others incorporated user characteristics and real-time context. Only 12 studies used medical records in conjunction with CAs for conditions like diabetes, mental health, cardiovascular issues, and cancer. Despite measurement method variations, the studies predominantly emphasized improved health outcomes and positive user attitudes toward CAs. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for CAs to adapt to evolving patient needs, customize interventions, and incorporate human support and medical records for more effective care. It also highlights the potential of CAs to play a more active role in helping individuals manage their conditions and notes the value of linguistic data generated during user interactions. The analysis acknowledges its limitations and encourages further research into the use and potential of CAs in disease-specific contexts.},

  abstract = {Online peer support groups (OPSGs) have been widely used in health and wellbeing interventions, but their effectiveness varies, influenced by the level of group engagement and the quality of interactions. This study explores the impact of structured elements, such as prompts and tasks, incorporated into OPSG design on peer support quality and group engagement. We analyse chat messages from two OPSGs aimed at reducing workplace sitting through exercise breaks. Despite identical study designs and similar participant demographics, the two OPSGs exhibited significant differences in group engagement, underscoring the importance of understanding group composition, organic interactions, and other factors influencing engagement. The findings emphasise the need for thoughtful OPSG design, including developing structured elements, to foster communication and improve the quality of interactions. Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to promote supportive exchange, focusing on the role of prompts, group cohesion, and social presence to enhance the effectiveness of OPSGs.},
