  abstract={Conversational agents are becoming more common in the health and wellness domains in part due to assumptions regarding potential improvements in individuals’ outcomes. This paper presents initial findings from a review of conversational agent use in healthcare for chronic conditions and well-being. A search of the literature was performed on electronic databases PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Scopus and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included if they were focused on chronic disorder management, disease prevention or lifestyle change and if systems were tested on target user groups. This paper investigates the health domains, the user profiles and reasons why conversational agents may be helpful in the selfmanagement of chronic disease and well-being. This paper also discusses how these tools may be used to improve the health and well-being of different groups of people.},

  abstract = {Prolonged sedentary behavior and insufficient physical activity increase the risk for non-communicable diseases. Online peer support groups, driven by the widespread use of mobile phones and social media, have gained popularity among people seeking health condition management advice. This position paper examines the role of online peer support groups within a behaviour change intervention, MOV’D (Move Often eVery Day), which promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior in the workplace. We conducted a thematic analysis of post-study interviews from two randomized control trials to identify the benefits and limitations of online peer support groups and provide recommendations for improvement. We found that participation in online peer support groups contributes to a sense of belonging and accountability, helps to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and application of the intervention content, and serves as reminders encouraging physical activity throughout the day. However, participants do not always have enough time and cognitive resources to read all the messages and actively participate in the group chats. Individual differences also contribute to a decrease in overall chat activity, as the group chat does not always meet all participant’s preferences and needs.},
